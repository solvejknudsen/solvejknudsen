## Hi and welcome to my GitHub

I'm a physicist and aspiring data scientist!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub, VS Code, ML, APIs, Web scraping, SQL, ...
- ðŸ‘£ I already know python, data visualization, simulation, statistics, advanced math, and more.
- ðŸ›¶ My most resent sidequest was to (lern how to) host, make, and design a website for my friend..
- ðŸ¥‹ In my sparetime, I like to fight with samurai swords (and have the black belt to prove it!)
