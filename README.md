## Hi and welcome to my GitHub

I'm a physicist and aspiring data scientist!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub, VS Code, ML, APIs, Web scraping, SQL, ...
âš¡ I already know python, data visualization, simulation, statistics, advanced math, and more. 
ðŸ˜„ In my sparetime, I like to fight with samurai swords (and have the black belt to prove it!)
