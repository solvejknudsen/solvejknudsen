## Hi and welcome to my GitHub

I'm a physicist and aspiring data scientist!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub, ML, APIs, Web scraping, SQL, ...
- 👣 I already know python, data visualization, simulation, statistics, advanced math, and more.
- 🛶 My most resent sidequest was to (learn how to) host, make, and design a website for my friend..
- 🥋 In my sparetime, I like to fight with samurai swords (and have the black belt to prove it!)
